\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:problem}
In this paper, we consider the landing of a dumbbell model of an under actuated spacecraft onto an asteroid.
The dumbbell model is a well-known representation of a multi body spacecraft.
Furthermore, the dumbbell model captures the important interactions of the coupling between orbital and attitude dynamics. 
The dumbbell spacecraft consists of two masses connected by a massless rod.
This simple model is useful to capture the main characteristics of a wide variety of spacecraft configurations.
Typically, spacecraft have mass concentrated in a central structure, referred to as the bus, which houses the command and control system, actuators, fuel, sensors etc. 
In addition, comparatively light-weight solar panels extend from the bus to provide electrical energy from solar radiation. 
As a result, the distributed mass of the spacecraft is captured with the dumbbell representation.

% most use a spherical harmonic model or a ellipsoid model but we use a polyhedron model
An accurate gravitational potential model is necessary for the operation of spacecraft about asteroids.
Additionally, a detailed shape model of the asteroid is needed for trajectories passing close to the body.
The classic approach is to expand the gravitational potential into a harmonic series and compute the series coefficients.
However, the harmonic expansion is always an approximation as a result of the infinite order series used in the representation.
Additionally, the harmonic model used outside of the circumscribing sphere is not guaranteed to converge inside the sphere, which makes it unsuitable for trajectories near the surface.
Instead, we use the polyhedron potential model to represent the shape of the asteroid and also the gravitational potential assuming a constant density~\cite{werner1994,werner1997}. 

The equations of motion of the dumbbell spacecraft about an asteroid are derived using Hamilton's Principle. 
The first step is to choose generalized coordinates \( q \) and a corresponding configuration space \( Q \).
The Lagrangian is then formed as the difference between the kinetic and potential energy in terms of our generalized coordinates. 
Hamilton's principle then states that the variation of the action integral
\begin{align}
    \mathsf{G} = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} T(\dot{q}) - V(q) dt,
\end{align}
is stationary with fixed endpoints. 
From this we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations for the system.
Applying the Legendre transformation allows for the same dynamics to be expressed in an equivalent form as Hamilton's equations~\cite{lanczos1970}.

There is a key issue that arises in applying this process for the coupled motion about an asteroid.
The configuration space for rigid body motion is the semi-direct product, \(\SE = \R^3 \rtimes \SO \), namely the special euclidean group.
The variations should be carefully constructed such that they respect the geometry of the configuration space.
By expressing the motion of the dumbbell directly on the special euclidean group, we avoid the issues inherent in using other kinematic representations which fail to preserve the geometric properties of the configuration space.

\subsection{Equations of Motion}

The kinematics of the dumbbell and asteroid are described in the inertial frame by
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \vecbf{x} \) - the position of the center of mass of the dumbbell spacecraft represented in the inertial frame \( \vecbf{e}_i\)
    \item \( R \) - the rotation matrix which transforms vectors defined in the spacecraft fixed frame, \( \vecbf{b}_i \), to the inertial frame, \( \vecbf{e}_i \)
    \item \( \vecbf{\Omega} \) - the angular velocity of the spacecraft body fixed frame relative to the inertial frame and represented in the dumbbell body fixed frame \( \vecbf{b}_i \)
    \item \( R_A \) - the rotation matrix which transforms vectors defined in the asteroid fixed frame, \( \vecbf{f}_i \), to the inertial frame, \( \vecbf{e}_i \)
\end{itemize}
In this work, we assume that the asteroid is much more massive than the spacecraft and it's motion is not affected by that of the spacecraft.
This assumption allows us to treat the motion of the vehicle independently from that of the asteroid. 

Using our kinematic variables we can define the kinetic and potential energy as
\begin{align}\label{eq:kinetic_energy}
    T &= \frac{1}{2} m \norm{\dot{\vb{x}}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \tr{S(\vb{\Omega}) J_d S(\vb{\Omega})^T} , \\
    V( \vecbf{x}, R ) &=  - m_1 U \parenth{R_A^T \parenth{\vecbf{x} + R \vecbf{\rho}_1}} - m_2 U \parenth{R_A^T \parenth{\vecbf{x} + R \vecbf{\rho}_2}} ,
\end{align}
where the polyhedron potential is defined as 
\begin{align}
    U(\vecbf{r}) &= \frac{1}{2} G \sigma \sum_{e \in \text{edges}} \vecbf{r}_e \cdot \vecbf{E}_e \cdot \vecbf{r}_e \cdot L_e - \frac{1}{2}G \sigma \sum_{f \in \text{faces}} \vecbf{r}_f \cdot \vecbf{F}_f \cdot \vecbf{r}_f \cdot \omega_f,
\end{align}
and \( \vecbf{r}_e\) and \(\vecbf{r}_f \) are the vectors from the spacecraft to any point on the respective edge or face, \( G\) is the universal gravitational constant, and \( \sigma \) is the constant density of the asteroid.
The position of each mass \(m_i\) of the dumbbell is defined in the dumbbell fixed frame by the vector \(\vb{\rho}_i\). 
The next step is to define the variations of the kinetic and potential energy to derive the equations of motion.
The variation of the potential and kinetic energy can then be defined as
\begin{align} 
    \delta V &= -\sum_{i=1}^2  m_i \parenth{R_A \deriv{U}{\vb{z}_i} }^T \delta \vb{x} + m_i \hat{\vb{\eta}}\cdot \hat{\vb{\rho}_1} R^T R_A \deriv{U}{\vb{z}_i}, \\
    \delta T &= \parenth{m_1 + m_2} \dot{\vecbf{x}}^T \delta \dot{\vb{x}} + \frac{1}{2} \tr{ - \dot{\hat{\vb{\eta}}} S(J \vb{\Omega}) + \hat{\vb{\eta}} S(\hat{ \vb{\Omega}} J \vb{\Omega})} , 
\end{align}
Finally, applying Hamilton's principle gives the inertial equations of motion of the dumbbell spacecraft as
\begin{align}
    \dot{\vb{x}} &= \vb{v}, \\
    \parenth{m_1 + m_2} \dot{\vecbf{v}} &= m_1 R_A \deriv{U}{\vecbf{z}_1} + m_2 R_A \deriv{U}{\vecbf{z}_2}, \\
    \dot{R} &= R S(\vb{\Omega}) , \\
    J \dot{\vecbf{\Omega}} + \vecbf{\Omega} \times J \vecbf{\Omega} &= \vecbf{M}_1 + \vecbf{M}_2.
\end{align}
The vectors \( \vecbf{z}_1 \) and \( \vecbf{z}_2\) define the position of the dumbbell masses as represented in the asteroid fixed frame and are defined as
\begin{align}
    \vecbf{z}_1 &= R_A^T \parenth{\vecbf{x} + R \vecbf{\rho}_1} , \\
    \vecbf{z}_2 &= R_A^T \parenth{\vecbf{x} + R \vecbf{\rho}_2}.
\end{align}
The gravitational moment on the dumbbell \( \vecbf{M}_i\) is defined as
\begin{align}
    \vecbf{M}_i = m_i \parenth{S(R_A^T \vb{\rho}_i) R^T \deriv{U}{\vb{z}_i}}.
\end{align}
 
In Reference~\citenum{kulumani2016d}, a methodology was developed to design general transfer trajectories about the asteroid 4769 Castalia.
That previous work utilized the polyhedron potential method and a reachability analysis to allow for a spacecraft to transition  between orbits of the asteroid.
\Cref{fig:trajectory} shows an example transfer between two planar equatorial orbits of 4769 Castalia.
Reference~\citenum{kulumani2016d} only considered the orbital dynamics of a point mass spacecraft. 
In this work, we incorporate the attitude dynamics and consider the coupled motion of the spacecraft.
In addition, a desired landing trajectory is followed using nonlinear control techniques.
